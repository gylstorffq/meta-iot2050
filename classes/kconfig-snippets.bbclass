KCONFIG_SNIPPETS = ""

# The following function defines the kconfig snippet system
# with automatich debian dependency injection
#
# To define a feature set, the user has to define the following
# variable to an empty string:
#
# KFEATURE_featurename = ""
#
# Then, required additions to the variables can be defined:
#
# KFEATURE_featurename[KCONFIG_SNIPPETS] = "file://snippet-file-name.snippet"
# KFEATURE_featurename[SRC_URI] = "file://required-file.txt"
# KFEATURE_featurename[DEPENDS] = "deb-pkg1 deb-pkg2 deb-pkg3"
# KFEATURE_featurename[DEBIAN_DEPENDS] = "deb-pkg1"
# KFEATURE_featurename[BUILD_DEB_DEPENDS] = "deb-pkg1,deb-pkg2,deb-pkg3"

# The 'KCONFIG_SNIPPETS' flag gives a list of URI entries, where only
# file:// is supported. These snippets are appended to the DEFCONFIG file.
#
# Features can depend on other features via the following mechanism:
#
# KFEATURE_DEPS[feature1] = "feature2"
